# Olivetti-Faces
A self-learning exercises to explore face recognition with unsupervised and supervised machine learning models.

## Models
1. KMeans Clustering
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Ridge Classifier
5. SGD Classifier
6. KNeighbors Classifier
7. SVC
8. Decision Tree Classifier

## Dimensionality Reduction
1. Principal Component Analysis

## Conclusion
There are a few more ways that can possibly improve the performance of the model:
1. Dimensionality reduction with KMeans clustering (distance to cluster center)
2. PCA + KMeans dimensionality reduction
3. Data Augmentation with mirroring faces (left and right mirror)
4. Data Augmentation with Gaussian Mixture Clustering generating new samples

But due to the fact that the model is already good enough (97.5% accuracy at test dataset) that we dont have to further fine tune it at this moment.\
So I will stop exploring the above listed possibilities here.
